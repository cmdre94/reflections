What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I got the following output:
		
C:\Users\ClifandMo\Desktop\Version_control\reflections> git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/ClifandMo/Desktop/Version_control/r
eflections/.git/

Then typed git status and got the following output:

C:\Users\ClifandMo\Desktop\Version_control\reflections [master +1 ~0 -0 !]> git
status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        lesson_1_reflections.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
C:\Users\ClifandMo\Desktop\Version_control\reflections [master +1 ~0 -0 !]>

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
git diff: when entered with no arguements compares the working directory and the staging area

git diff --staged: with no arguments compares the staging area and the most recent commit in the repository

git reomve --hard: with no arguments discards changes in the staging area and the working directory

Commands:
git log
git clone
git checkout
git diff
git status
git add
git commit
git diff --staged
git remove --hard
