What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I got the following output:
		
C:\Users\ClifandMo\Desktop\Version_control\reflections> git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/ClifandMo/Desktop/Version_control/r
eflections/.git/

Then typed git status and got the following output:

C:\Users\ClifandMo\Desktop\Version_control\reflections [master +1 ~0 -0 !]> git
status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        lesson_1_reflections.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
C:\Users\ClifandMo\Desktop\Version_control\reflections [master +1 ~0 -0 !]>

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is temporary.  The working directory is permanent unless it's deleted.
