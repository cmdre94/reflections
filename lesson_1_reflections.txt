How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It did not take as long as searching manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could modify it from a certain point.  It also makes it easier to debug.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Auto-save will save too often making it possible to save when nothing has changed.  Saving manually: You might no save often enough.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The different version control systems were created for different purposes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to view the commits.  Use git diff to compare two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can open an earlier version.  No risk of having to spend hours trying to find an error.
